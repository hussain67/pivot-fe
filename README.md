# Pivot
Pivot questions are diagnostic questions during a presentation that allow presenters to identify misconceptions. Pivot allows a presenter to attach response data to Google slides so that audience can vote and receive feedback. 

- This app requires code from three different repositories. Please check Backend Repo first.

## Pivot-Frontend-Teacher

The teacher frontend allows for viewing of the original presentation slides as static images and control of polling.
The teacher can display the total results on the board.
